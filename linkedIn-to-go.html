    LinkedIn-To-Go
    <h2></h2>
    Introduction: Linkedin-to-go is a portable device equipped with NFC
    technology that allows users to easily connect with other LinkedIn users by
    simply tapping the device. The device is smaller than a typical tablet, but
    larger than a standard business card, measuring 750 pixels in width and 1334
    pixels in height. The device enables users to manage their LinkedIn profile,
    view recent connections, navigate to other profiles, and share files with
    each other. This project focuses on the software and web development aspect
    of the device, using HTML5, CSS3, JS, NODEjs, expressjs, and MONGODB. - The
    goal of this device is: - The success metrics for the device is defined by
    the number of devices sold and the no. of tabs per devices generated ##
    Motivation: (Background) I was eagerly anticipating the Grace Hopper
    Celebration 2022, a conference where women in technology come together to
    network, learn, and grow. As a software engineer, I was excited to connect
    with other professionals in my field, exchange ideas, and make meaningful
    connections. However, I soon realized that simply carrying a hard copy of my
    resume and cover letter would not be enough to stand out and be remembered
    by those I met beyond the conference. I faced several challenges. (re-work)
    - Firstly, the time constraint for every individual to go through the resume
    and connect (who has the time to read a complete resume or cover letter
    during a busy conference?) - Secondly, inability to follow the link on the
    resume and connect in less than 1 minute (how would anyone be able to
    navigate through my web development work with a hard copy? I wanted people
    to be able to visit my Github profile or portfolio website, but that was not
    possible with a traditional approach. - Lastly, I wasn't just looking for
    job opportunities; I wanted to connect with like-minded women and share my
    story. Why would my fellow companions want to read my resume when they would
    rather connect with me on social media? As a software engineer, I felt like
    I would miss out on opportunities of not being able to share my work in a
    more interactive way. That's when I realized I needed to carry a business
    card that was easy to carry, quick to read, and scannable for connectivity.
    However, I wasn't a businesswoman, and I wasn't selling a product; I was
    selling myself. I was my own product. I decided to create a connection card
    that would serve as a mini LinkedIn profile. A card that would feature a
    photo of me, a brief description of my work, and contact information. It
    would allow people to scan a QR code and instantly connect with me on
    LinkedIn. Hence, the name "LinkedIn to-go." Unfortunately, just before the
    conference, I accidentally broke my phone screen and was unable to navigate
    my phone. This was a significant setback, but LinkedIn to-go ended up being
    a lifesaver. Everyone I met at GHC loved the idea and design of the card. I
    was able to connect with many people through the QR code scanning feature,
    and the positive feedback was overwhelming. One of the most memorable
    moments was when a product manager from LinkedIn approached me and
    appreciated my creativity and vision for the card. Another attendee, a
    Disney employee, was critical of the sustainability of the physical card and
    pushed me to take the concept to a software level. I took this feedback to
    heart and decided to work on this project when I returned home. Creating
    LinkedIn to-go and sharing it at GHC was a reminder of the power of
    creativity and innovation in networking. It taught me that a simple idea,
    with the right execution, can have a significant impact. The feedback I
    received was inspiring and motivating, and it pushed me to take this idea to
    the next level. I am excited to see how LinkedIn to-go can change the game
    for networking, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have shared it with
    so many amazing women in tech at GHC. ## Unique Value Proposition The
    market-fit of LinkedIn to go goes beyond providing a portable device for
    connecting with others on LinkedIn. While some may argue that this solution
    is similar to what most mobile phones already do, the actual problem isn't
    about portability but rather lies elsewhere. To understand the issue at
    hand, let's ask ourselves a question: Why do we damage our phones so
    frequently? The answer is simple: we use our phones for everything. With
    multiple features and capabilities, our phones can be used for both work and
    leisure purposes. While this may seem promising, it can also create
    confusion for the user about the phone's purpose. They haven't yet decided
    if their phone is meant for personal or professional use, and this can lead
    to inefficiency and a lack of focus. This is where LinkedIn to go comes in
    and solves the issue by providing a device solely dedicated to the user's
    professional life. The device is small and portable, allowing the user to
    carry it at all times and only pull it out for special occasions or specific
    reasons, reducing the confusion between personal and professional use.
    Additionally, LinkedIn is a social media platform for professionals in
    various fields, including musicians, actors, and artists. In recent trends,
    many people from non-technical fields are becoming active on LinkedIn to
    manage their professional networking and career development. LinkedIn to go
    aims to serve all kinds of people, including those in creative industries
    who may struggle to showcase their work in social situations. For example,
    imagine a musician attending a party to connect with different directors and
    artists. LinkedIn to go lets the user share their work with their
    connections, thereby solving this issue too. In summary, LinkedIn to go
    offers a unique solution to the confusion created by using mobile phones for
    both personal and professional purposes. It provides a dedicated device for
    managing one's professional networking on LinkedIn, and its small size and
    portability make it an ideal solution for professionals on the go. ## Key

    Directions for LinkedIn-to-go - Integration of NFC technology: As mentioned,
    the project will require the development of NFC technology to make the
    device work. In the future, there may be advancements in this technology
    that could improve the device's functionality and make it more secure. -
    Partnerships with other companies: There may be opportunities to partner
    with other companies to integrate the device into their products or
    services. For example, a company in the event industry may be interested in
    using the device for networking purposes at their events. - Integration with
    other platforms: While the initial focus is on LinkedIn, there may be
    opportunities to integrate with other professional networking platforms or
    even social media platforms. This would require additional development work
    and potentially partnerships with those platforms. - Expansion to other
    markets: While the project is initially focused on a specific geographic
    market, there may be potential to expand to other markets in the future.
    This would require additional research and potentially partnerships with
    local companies or organizations. - Development of additional features: As
    the project evolves, there may be opportunities to develop additional
    features that enhance the user experience or provide additional value. This
    could include things like analytics, customized profiles, or even AI-powered
    matchmaking for networking purposes.
